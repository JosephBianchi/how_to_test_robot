Try running ruby test_robot.rb. If all is well, you should see 8 skipped tests and no error messages.
Read the code in robot.rb and the descriptions of the unit test to be implemented in test_robot.rb.
One by one, remove skip from each unit test and in its place write your test code. In the end your test output should read
8 runs, 8 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
